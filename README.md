Dragon Pixel
============

Dragon Pixel is a game that I have developed in my early java days.

This is one of my very first projects that I started developing in java with use of my starters expertise.
I started working on this around 2010 and spend about a month working on it.

I wouldn't recommend anyone to follow this coding structure as it's insufficient and also unreliable.
The only reason to why I have chosen to publicly release the source code is because I think that some of the resources may be useful for others.

Map Editing
---
The map works of a tileset which can be found inside of `res/Maps/`
There you are able to edit the maps tileset and the game would load it dynamically from the file.
